# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to study fifteen school districts and their students to compare reading and math scores. School spending, school size, and school type were also studied to compare reading and math scores among the fifteen schools. The school board also wanted to repeat the school district analysis after math and reading scores were removed from the database for Thomas High School ninth graders.
